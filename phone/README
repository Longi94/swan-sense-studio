* Tool for generating your own sensors --> interdroid/interdroid-swan-tools (GitHub)

* Steps to create a custom sensor:
    1. change AndroidManifest.xml accordingly (look for rainsensor to see how it's done); don't forget to add the corresponding service
    2. add the valuepaths in res/values/arrays.xml
    3. add sensor preferences in res/xml/[sensorname]_preferences.xml
    4. create sensor class in interdroid/swan/sensors/impl/[sensorname].java that extends AbstractSwanSensor

* Which classes/methods do what:

    EvaluationManager.bindToSensor() --> binds to a sensor when registering an expression
    EvaluationManager.initializeRemote() --> send expression registration request to remote device

* Compile sources into jar:

    jar -cf [swan.jar] [classes_dir]

!!! When creating a service, don't forget to add it to Manifest !!!

    1. switch to release branch
    2. merge changes from master and fix conflicts in Manifest
    3. switch from "debug" to "release" in the Build Variants
    4. Build -> Generate Signed APK
    5. Upload the APK to Google Play
